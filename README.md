## History

### Origin

This started as a quick private project to fix my earphones by resoldering the wires. The challenge was to generate all possible wiring combinations.

My earphones had two main components requiring connection to the circuit:

1. The AUX audio connector jack had 4 wires - green, red, copper, blue - connecting to one side of the circuit with joints named: Left, Right, Ground, Microphone.

2. The pair of speakers had 3 wires combined - green, red, copper - connecting to the other side of the circuit with joints named: Left, Right, Ground.

### Naive Solution

The initial version of the code, totaling 50 lines, produced a simple JSON output consisting of 124 possible wiring combinations:

```javascript
[
  {
    Circuit: { Blue: "G", Red: "M", Green: "R", Copper: "L" },
    Sound: { Red: "R", Copper: "G", Green: "L" }
  },
  {
    Circuit: { Blue: "G", Red: "M", Green: "R", Copper: "L" },
    Sound: { Red: "R", Copper: "L", Green: "G" }
  },
  // ... (122 more combinations)
]
```

### Optimized Solution

To enhance efficiency, I calculated the required resoldering by summing up differences between each combination, totaling 392.

Motivated to minimize the workload, I spent two weeks researching, experimenting by writing down thoughts on a piece of paper, updating my combinatorics functions, and testing. I developed an algorithm to reduce the difference between every adjacent combination by 2â€”the minimum physically achievable.

This new algorithm resulted in a reduction of 106 in required resoldering, bringing the total down to 286.

### Journey of Improvement

After discovering the solution, I found myself immersed in a continuous cycle of code refactoring. I became interested in improving my skills by creating modular, readable, and testable code.

This journey spanned a couple of months, filled with what felt like endless refactoring sessions. During this time, I had to adjust the structure, group and divide components, extract code segments, write comfortable unit tests, and give meaningful names to common utility functions.

It felt like there were almost unlimited ways to solve programming problems and write code. I learned that perfection is not possible, and there are always some tradeoffs.

I should focus on the things that matter. My goal is to efficiently write useful programs in the future while avoiding unnecessary distractions.

### How it Works <!-- TODO -->
The primary functionality of this project is built upon `combination` and `permutation` algorithms.

This combinatoric functions are used to create all possible combinations of wiring earphone components to the circuit.

The program gets input from `settings` json object in the `src/index.js` file.
   ```js
   const settings = {
     Jack: {
       L: "Green",
       R: "Red",
       G: "Copper",
       M: "Blue"
     },
     Speakers: {
       L: "Green",
       R: "Red",
       G: "Copper"
     }
   };
   ```
* The `settings` object can contain any amount of `wiring groups`, `wires` and `joints`.
* The type of the `settings` object is `Record<string, <Record<string, string>>`.

* The current `wirings` object containts `wire groups` for earphone audio jack and speakers that should be connected to the circuit.
* Each `wiring group` contains key-value pair of `wire` and `joint` that can be soldered together.

---

For wiring settings with `4` wirings in the `audio jack` and `3` wirings in `the speakers` there would be `((4! * 3!) - 1) * 2 = 286` amount of resoldering needed to try all combinations with minimum amount of soldering possible.

* `4! * 3! = 144` is amount of combinations.
* `144 - 1 = 143` is amount of transitions between combinations.
* `143 * 2 = 286` is amount of resoldering required to transition between all combinations.

Multiplication by `2` accurs because of switching 2 `wires` with places.
