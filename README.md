## History

### Origin

This started as a quick private project to fix my earphones by resoldering the wires. The challenge was to generate all possible wiring combinations.

My earphones had two main components requiring connection to the circuit:

1. The AUX audio connector jack had 4 wires - green, red, copper, blue - connecting to one side of the circuit with joints named: Left, Right, Ground, Microphone.

2. The pair of speakers had 3 wires combined - green, red, copper - connecting to the other side of the circuit with joints named: Left, Right, Ground.

### Naive Solution

The initial version of the code, totaling 50 lines, produced a simple JSON output consisting of 124 possible wiring combinations:

```javascript
[
  {
    Circuit: { Blue: "G", Red: "M", Green: "R", Copper: "L" },
    Sound: { Red: "R", Copper: "G", Green: "L" }
  },
  {
    Circuit: { Blue: "G", Red: "M", Green: "R", Copper: "L" },
    Sound: { Red: "R", Copper: "L", Green: "G" }
  },
  // ... (122 more combinations)
]
```

### Optimized Solution

To enhance efficiency, I calculated the required resoldering by summing up differences between each combination, totaling 392.

Motivated to minimize the workload, I spent two weeks researching, experimenting by writing down thoughts on a piece of paper, updating my combinatorics functions, and testing. I developed an algorithm to reduce the difference between every adjacent combination by 2â€”the minimum physically achievable.

This new algorithm resulted in a reduction of 106 in required resoldering, bringing the total down to 286.

### Journey of Improvement

After discovering the solution, I found myself immersed in a continuous cycle of code refactoring. I became interested in improving my skills by creating modular, readable, and testable code.

This journey spanned a couple of months, filled with what felt like endless refactoring sessions. During this time, I had to adjust the structure, group and divide components, extract code segments, write comfortable unit tests, and give meaningful names to common utility functions.

It felt like there were almost unlimited ways to solve programming problems and write code. I learned that perfection is not possible, and there are always some tradeoffs.

I should focus on the things that matter. My goal is to efficiently write useful programs in the future while avoiding unnecessary distractions.

### How it Works

The program is initiated using `npm start`, which triggers the execution of the `src/index.js` file.
The program uses the input of the type `Record<string, <Record<string, string>>` from the `settings` JSON object in the file.

```js
const settings = {
   Jack: { L: "Green", R: "Red", G: "Copper", M: "Blue" },
   Speakers: { L: "Green", R: "Red", G: "Copper" }
};
```

The core functionality of this project is built using combination and permutation algorithms.
These combinatoric functions are used to generate all possible combinations of wiring earphone components (jack and speakers in our example) to the circuit.
This is accomplished by combining all possible permutations of each earphone component wiring.
### Permutations

The `mapValues` utility function and `getMinDiffDictPermutations` are used to replace all values in the `settings` object with permutations:

```js
const permutations = {
   Jack: [
      { L: "Green", R: "Red", G: "Copper", M: "Blue" },
      { L: "Green", R: "Red", G: "Blue", M: "Copper" },
      // ... (22 more permutations)
   ],
   Speakers: [
      { L: "Green", R: "Red", G: "Copper" },
      { L: "Green", R: "Copper", G: "Red" },
      // ... (4 more permutations)
   ]
}
```

`getMinDiffDictPermutations` looks like the `getPermutations` function with some key differences:
* **Dict**: It operates on a dictionary (`Dict`) instead of an array.
The type signature is `(Record<string, T>) => Record<string, T>[]` as opposed to `(T[]) => T[][]` in the array variant (`getPermutations`).
This allows the use of string names for positions rather than number indices.
* **MinDiff**: It optimizes the algorithm to minimize the difference between every permutation.
This optimization is illustrated in the `test/permutations/array.js` and `test/permutationsOptimization/array.js` test files.

**Result**:
* `Jack` has `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24` total permutations because it has `4` values.
* `Speakers` has `3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6` total permutations because it has `3` values.
### Combinations

Following the permutation stage, the program combines all the wiring `permutations` and uses `getMinDiffDictCombinations` to generate combinations:

`getMinDiffDictCombinations` is like `getCombinations` function with similar differences as `getMinDiffDictPermutations` has with `permutations`:

`getMinDiffDictCombinations` looks like the `getCombinations` function with some key differences:
* **Dict**: It operates on a dictionary (`Dict`) instead of an array.
The type signature is `(Record<string, T[]>) => Record<string, T>[]` as opposed to `(T[][]) => T[][]` in the array variant (`getCombinations`).
This allows the use of string names for positions rather than number indices.
* **MinDiff**: It optimizes the algorithm to minimize the difference between every permutation.
This optimization is illustrated in the `test/combinations/array.js` and `test/combinationsOptimization/array.js` test files.

**Result**:
* In total, `4! * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144` combinations are generated by combining permutations.
* The `144` combination count means that there are `144 - 1 = 143` transitions between the combinations.
* The `143` transition count means that `143 * 2 = 286` values are changed to transfer between every combination.

The multiplication by `2` occurs because `2` is the minimum number of values that need to be updated to generate a new permutation by switching `2` values.
